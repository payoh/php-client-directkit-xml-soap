The Payoh API (called Directkit) has two implementations: Directkit**Json2** and Directkit**Xml**. 
There are different ways to call the service depends on the implementation you chose.

The best way to access to directkit**Json2** is to use the [`curl_init`] function to send POST request to the Directkit**Json2** service. 

[See the example here](https://github.com/payoh/php-client-directkit-json2)

It is the simplest and the most network-efficient way. 
 
If you don't like the json format, you can also send SOAP (XML) requests to Directkit**Xml**, you can do it in 3 different ways:

 1. **[SoapClient]**: the casual method in PHP to consume any Web Service. It is the simplest way to access to SOAP request.
 2. **[SoapClient SDK]**: same with the first method, but all the structure of requests / responses are generated overhead with [`wsdl2phpgenerator`](http://wsdl2phpgenerator.github.io/wsdl2phpgenerator/)
 3. **[Payoh SDK]**: call the web service as a normal http request [`curl_init`]. The SDK will help you to parse the SOAP response.

This example demonstrates the first method.

It is tested with PHP 5.4.31 and PHP 7.

# Required extensions

In order to use [`SoapClient`], you have to activate the following extensions in `php.ini`

  * `extension=php_soap.dll` (Windows) or `soap.so` (Linux)
  * `extension=php_openssl.dll` (Windows) or `openssl.so` (Linux)

# Sample codes

```php
$client = new SoapClient(DIRECTKIT_WS."?wsdl");

$response = $client->GetWalletTransHistory(array(
        "wlLogin" => LOGIN,
        "wlPass" => PASSWORD,
        "language" => "fr",
        "version" => VERSION,
        "walletIp" => getUserIP(),
        "walletUa" => UA,
        "wallet" => "8888"
    ));

//print the response
echo "<pre>".json_encode($response, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT)."</pre>";
```

# SoapClient WSDL cache

(Please refer to the [SoapClient manual](http://php.net/manual/en/class.soapclient.php) for more information)
  
The SoapClient relies upon the WebService description (WSDL) to validate every SOAP requests and parse the SOAP responses. Your PHP Server will download and cache the WSDL in the first call.

> You must to keep your WSDL cache in sync with the WebService.

If you got
```
Fatal error: Uncaught SoapFault exception...
```
In most case, it means that your cached WSDL is outdated, please refresh the cache using one of the following methods.

# Manipulate the SoapClient WSDL cache in `php.ini`

In `php.ini` you can configure the cache folder and the expire time (ttl) of the WSDL cache or disable it completly.
```
[soap]
soap.wsdl_cache_enabled=1
soap.wsdl_cache_dir="/tmp"
soap.wsdl_cache_ttl=86400
```

You must to restart PHP server (or Apache) each changes in `php.ini`.

But **You can also force refresh the cache by deleting every `wsdl-*` files in the folder `wsdl_cache_dir`**. No need to restart your PHP Server.

# Manipulate the SoapClient WSDL cache in code

Please refer to the [SoapClient configuration](http://php.net/manual/en/soap.configuration.php) for more information

* Disable cache usage:
```php
ini_set("soap.wsdl_cache_enabled", 0);
```

* Redefine the expire time to 10 seconds so the cache will refreshed sooner / more frequently:
```php
ini_set("soap.wsdl_cache_ttl", 10);
```
